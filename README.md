# 🎧 Pixel September Playlist Note 🍂✨  

Hi! I’m Parneet Sandhu, and this is my submission for the **September 2025: Vibe Coding Challenge**.  

The idea came when I was listening to **Taylor Swift’s “September”** and thought: *what if moods could be pinned down like sticky notes… but with music?*  
So I built **Pixel September Playlist Note** — a cozy app where songs, moods, and quotes live together in a cute pixel theme.

## 🤖 How I Used GitHub Copilot  

Since this challenge was about **using Copilot**, I leaned on it a lot while building:  

- Autocompleted **React/TypeScript boilerplate** (hooks, states, props).  
- Suggested **logic for theme switching and search functionality**.  
- Helped me debug little issues with UI + state management.  
- Sometimes gave funny/wrong suggestions 😅 — but that taught me to debug smarter.  

Copilot wasn’t just writing code; it felt like a coding buddy ✨.

- Designing apps that mix **music + mood + aesthetics** into something simple and fun.

songs as sticky notes, pixel themes, and a cozy quote every day.
